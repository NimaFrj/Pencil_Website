**This is a [Pen or Pencil classifier](pencil.qmd).** <br><br>
It's whole objective is to simply classify whether the input is the picture of a pen or a pencil. <br>
I've trained it with a simple resnet architecture and it was only trained with 30 pictures. <br>
So, don't expect it to be super accurate.
I'll train it with more data later if I find it necessary! <br>
I just wanted to create a project in production and wanted a simple classifier to begin with, and there was a pen and a pencil at my desk. So, I thought I should classify these as my first project.

Here is the **[classifier](pencil.qmd)**.
