    "text": "This is a Pen or Pencil classifier.  It’s whole objective is to simply classify whether the input is the picture of a pen or a pencil.  I’ve trained it with a simple resnet architecture and it was only trained with 30 pictures.  So, don’t expect it to be super accurate. I’ll train it with more data later if I find it necessary!  I just wanted to create a project in production and wanted a simple classifier to begin with, and there was a pen and a pencil at my desk. So, I thought I should classify these as my first project.\n\nHere is the classifier."
